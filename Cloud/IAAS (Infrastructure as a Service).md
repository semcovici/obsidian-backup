Use only infrastructure from cloud provider. ==The cloud is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity and physical security. Everything beyond that is the responsibility of the user.==

Example: Using VM to deploy your applications or databases

The user is responsible for:
* app code and runtime
* configuring load balancer
* auto scaling 
* OS upgrades and patches 
* availability
