Serveless does NOT mean "No Servers"

Means that um do not have to worry about infrastructure (0 visibility into infrastructure)
* Flexible sclaing and automated high availability
* Pay for use: ideally -> ZERO REQUESTS => ZERO COST

The focus is on code and the cloud managed service takes care of all that is needed to scale your code to serve millions of requests. ==You pay for requests NOT servers==
