## What is an agent?

There is no objetive definition for "agent". But we can put the definition below:

> [!NOTE] Agent
> An agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application

Agents can be a simple system where an LLM routes between two different paths or even advanced, autonomous, and human like.

There are different degrees to which systems can be agentic.

> [!NOTE] Agentic
> The system is more "agentic" the more an LLM decides how the system can behave.

Using an LLM to route inputs into a particular downstream workflow has some small amount of “agentic” behavior. This would fall into the `Router` category in the above diagram.
