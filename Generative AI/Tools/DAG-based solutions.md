**Directed Acyclic Graph** (DAG) is a type of graph that is made up of nodes connected by edges, where the edges have a direction **(directed)** and the graph has no cycles (**Acyclic**)

**DAG-based solutions** refer to approaches that utilize DAGs to optimize, organize, or represent the computation and data flows within the [[LLM]]s
